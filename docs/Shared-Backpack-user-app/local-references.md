### find people who know the place
- we believe in the fact that people know their own turf better.
    - Taking this in mind we find people who are fimiliar with 
    places that you want to visit
- Locals can volunteer to show us the real zen of the place 
along with the past, present and the probable future of the place.
- They'll show you the real culture of the place after all travelling
is knowing new and different kinds of people and experiences things in
life that we won't be able to do in our daily routine.
